                    Iâ€™m a junior web developer who learned web development through Programming Hero. I enjoy creating websites and solving problems through coding. Watching anime is one of my favorite hobbies, and it often inspires me to think creatively. I am passionate about learning new technologies and improving my skills every day. Building websites allows me to turn ideas into reality, which gives me great satisfaction. I also enjoy exploring different design styles to make websites look modern and user-friendly. My goal is to grow as a developer and contribute to exciting projects while continuing to learn and do what I love.
